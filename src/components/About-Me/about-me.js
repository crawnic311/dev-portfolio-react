      It's no secret that I love to learn and challenge myself. After a few
      years working in operations I knew I needed a new challenge. I followed my

      <br></br>I like the outdoors, the indoors, excellent foods, and keeping up
      with each new installment of the Legend of Zelda series. I've lived all
      over the US but these Utah mountains have convinced me to stay put for
      now.
